nophr: Config-First Personal Nostr-to-Gopher/Gemini/Finger Gateway

Overview
- Serves Nostr content via Gopher (RFC 1436), Gemini (gemini://), and Finger (RFC 742) protocols only.
- Single-tenant by default; shows one operator's notes and articles from Nostr.
- Everything configurable via file and env overrides; no hard-coded relays.
- Inbox/Outbox model to aggregate replies, reactions, and zaps from Nostr.
- Seed-relay bootstrap; dynamic relay discovery via NIP-65 (kind 10002).
- Controlled synchronization scope (self/following/mutual/FOAF depth) with caps and allow/deny lists.
- Embedded Khatru relay for event storage; SQLite or LMDB backend (no PostgreSQL).
- Protocol-specific rendering: Gopher menus/text, Gemini gemtext, Finger user info.
- Composable layouts: sections defined by filters; sensible defaults and archives.
- Privacy and safety: env-only secrets, pruning, deny-lists, and diagnostics.

Status
- This directory documents the design decisions and plan. The codebase implements many of these phases already; memory/ remains the source of truth and must stay in sync with implementation.

Implementation Guide:
- PHASES.md (phased implementation plan with deliverables and completion criteria)
- ../AGENTS.md (instructions for AI agents working on this project)
