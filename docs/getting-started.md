# Getting Started with Nopher

**Status:** âœ… VERIFIED (Configuration, storage, and sync engine) / ðŸŸ¡ IMPLEMENTED (Protocol servers undergoing verification)

Nopher is a personal gateway that serves your Nostr content via legacy internet protocols: Gopher (RFC 1436), Gemini, and Finger (RFC 742).

This guide covers installation, initial configuration, and first run.

## Prerequisites

**For one-line install:** curl or wget

**For building from source:**
- **Go 1.23 or later**
- **Make** - for build automation
- **Git** - for cloning the repository
- **golangci-lint** (optional) - for running linters during development

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Use the one-line installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://nopher.io/install.sh | sh
```

This will:
- Detect your platform and architecture
- Download the latest release
- Install to `/usr/local/bin/nopher`
- Create example configuration

**For more installation options** (Docker, packages, etc.), see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sandwich/nopher.git
cd nopher

# Build the binary
make build

# The binary will be in dist/nopher
./dist/nopher --version
```

You should see output like:
```
nopher dev
  commit: abc1234
  built:  2025-10-24T12:00:00Z
  by:     manual
```

### Install System-Wide (Optional)

```bash
# Install to /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)
sudo make install

# Verify installation
nopher --version
```

## Initial Configuration

Nopher uses a YAML configuration file. Generate an example configuration:

```bash
# Generate example configuration
./dist/nopher init > nopher.yaml
```

### Minimum Required Configuration

Edit `nopher.yaml` and configure these essential settings:

```yaml
site:
  title: "My Nostr Site"
  description: "Personal Nostr gateway"
  operator: "Your Name"

identity:
  npub: "npub1..." # Your Nostr public key (REQUIRED)

relays:
  seeds:
    - "wss://relay.damus.io"
    - "wss://relay.nostr.band"
    - "wss://nos.lol"
```

**Important:** You must provide your `npub` (Nostr public key). This identifies whose content to serve.

### Optional: Private Key (Publishing)

If you want to publish content (future feature), set your private key via environment variable:

```bash
export NOPHER_NSEC="nsec1..."  # Your Nostr private key (NEVER in config file!)
```

**Security Note:** Never put `nsec` in the config file. Always use the `NOPHER_NSEC` environment variable.

## Validate Configuration

Test that your configuration is valid:

```bash
./dist/nopher --config nopher.yaml
```

If configuration is valid, you should see:
```
Starting nopher dev
  Site: My Nostr Site
  Operator: Your Name
  Identity: npub1...

Initializing storage...
  Storage: sqlite initialized
Initializing aggregates manager...
  Aggregates manager ready
Initializing sync engine...
  Sync engine started
Starting Gopher server on localhost:70...
  Gopher server ready
Starting Gemini server on localhost:1965...
  Gemini server ready
Starting Finger server on port 79...
  Finger server ready

âœ“ All services started successfully!
```

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Configuration loading works
- âœ… Storage initialization works
- âœ… Sync engine integrated and working
- ðŸŸ¡ Protocol servers (Gopher/Gemini/Finger) implemented, undergoing verification

## Understanding the Configuration

The generated configuration includes many sections:

| Section | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `site` | Site metadata (title, description) | âœ… Verified |
| `identity` | Your npub/nsec | âœ… Verified |
| `protocols` | Enable/disable Gopher, Gemini, Finger | ðŸŸ¡ Implemented |
| `relays` | Seed relays and connection policies | âœ… Verified |
| `discovery` | Relay discovery settings (NIP-65) | âœ… Verified |
| `sync` | Event synchronization (enabled/scope/retention) | âœ… Verified |
| `inbox` | Aggregation of replies/reactions/zaps | âœ… Verified |
| `outbox` | Publishing settings (future) | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| `storage` | Database backend (SQLite/LMDB) | âœ… Verified |
| `rendering` | Protocol-specific rendering options | ðŸŸ¡ Implemented |
| `caching` | Response caching (memory/Redis) | âœ… Verified |
| `logging` | Log level configuration | âœ… Verified |
| `layout` | Custom sections and pages | ðŸŸ¡ Implemented |

For complete configuration documentation, see [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Storage Backend

Nopher stores Nostr events in a local database using [Khatru](https://github.com/fiatjaf/khatru) (embedded Nostr relay).

**Default:** SQLite at `./data/nopher.db`

```yaml
storage:
  driver: "sqlite"              # or "lmdb"
  sqlite_path: "./data/nopher.db"
```

The database file will be created automatically on first run.

For more on storage backends, see [storage.md](storage.md).

## Next Steps

Now that you have Nopher configured:

1. **Test Protocol Servers** (once verified):
   - Connect to Gopher: `telnet localhost 70` (or use a Gopher client like lynx/VF-1)
   - Connect to Gemini: Use a Gemini client like amfora or lagrange
   - Connect to Finger: `finger @localhost` (or `telnet localhost 79`)

2. **Understand Nostr Integration**:
   - Learn how sync works: [nostr-integration.md](nostr-integration.md)
   - Configure sync scope (self/following/mutual/FOAF)

3. **Customize Rendering**:
   - Adjust line lengths, timestamps, formatting: [protocols.md](protocols.md)

4. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Run as systemd service, configure ports: [deployment.md](deployment.md)

## Development

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run Linters

```bash
make lint
```

### Run All Checks

```bash
make check
```

### Development Mode

Run directly from source with live reloading:

```bash
make dev
```

This runs `go run ./cmd/nopher --config ./configs/nopher.example.yaml`.

```

## Troubleshooting

### "identity.npub is required"

You forgot to set your `npub` in `nopher.yaml`. Get your npub from any Nostr client.

### "failed to initialize storage: unable to open database file"

The directory for the database doesn't exist. Create it:
```bash
mkdir -p ./data
```

### "port already in use"

Another service is using one of the protocol ports (70, 79, or 1965). Either:
- Stop the conflicting service
- Change the port in `nopher.yaml`
- Disable that protocol

### "permission denied" binding to port

Ports below 1024 require root/sudo permissions. Either:
- Run with sudo: `sudo ./dist/nopher --config nopher.yaml`
- Use port forwarding: `iptables` to forward 70â†’7070, etc.
- Change ports in config to >1024 (testing only)
