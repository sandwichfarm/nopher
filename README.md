# nophr

**Nostr to Gopher/Gemini/Finger Gateway**

nophr is a personal gateway that serves your Nostr content via legacy internet protocols: Gopher (RFC 1436), Gemini, and Finger (RFC 742).

## Overview

- **Single-tenant** by default - shows one operator's notes and articles from Nostr
- **Config-first** - everything configurable via file and env overrides
- **Protocol servers** - Gopher, Gemini, and Finger simultaneously
- **Inbox/Outbox model** - aggregates replies, reactions, and zaps from Nostr
- **Smart relay discovery** - uses NIP-65 (kind 10002) for dynamic relay hints
- **Controlled sync scope** - sync self/following/mutual/FOAF with caps and deny lists
- **Embedded storage** - uses Khatru relay with SQLite or LMDB backend
- **Protocol-specific rendering** - gopher menus, gemini gemtext, finger responses

## Status

⚠️ **Early Development** - Not yet ready for production use.

Current implementation status:
- ✅ Configuration system with YAML parsing, validation, and display customization
- ✅ Storage layer with Khatru integration and SQLite backend
- ✅ Custom tables for relay hints, social graph, sync state, and aggregates
- ✅ Nostr client with relay discovery and event synchronization
- ✅ Protocol servers: Gopher (RFC 1436), Gemini (with TLS), and Finger (RFC 742)
- ✅ Content rendering with markdown support for all protocols
- ✅ Aggregates system for interaction tracking (reactions, zaps, replies)
- ✅ Display customization with headers, footers, and content filtering
- ✅ Comprehensive caching layer (memory and Redis support)

The core functionality is implemented and working. Focus is now on polish, optimization, and additional features.

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sandwich/nophr.git
cd nophr

# Build
make build

# Run
./dist/nophr --version
```

### Generate Configuration

```bash
# Generate example configuration
./dist/nophr init > nophr.yaml

# Edit with your npub and seed relays
vim nophr.yaml

# Validate configuration (note: protocol servers not yet implemented)
./dist/nophr --config nophr.yaml
```

## Development

## Architecture

nophr follows a config-first philosophy with clear separation of concerns:

- **Storage Layer** - Khatru relay with SQLite/LMDB
- **Sync Engine** - Discovers and syncs from Nostr relays
- **Protocol Servers** - Gopher (port 70), Gemini (port 1965), Finger (port 79)
- **Rendering** - Protocol-specific content transformation
- **Caching** - In-memory or Redis for performance

For detailed architecture, see `memory/architecture.md`.
